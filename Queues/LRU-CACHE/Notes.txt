How to implement LRU caching scheme? What data structures should be used?

We are given total possible page numbers that can be referred. We are also 
given cache (or memory) size (Number of page frames that cache can hold at a 
time). The LRU caching scheme is to remove the least recently used frame when 
the cache is full and a new page is referenced which is not there in cache. 
Please see the Galvin book for more details (see the LRU page replacement slide here).

We use two data structures to implement an LRU Cache.

    Queue which is implemented using a doubly linked list. The maximum size of the 
    queue will be equal to the total number of frames available (cache size). 
    The most recently used pages will be near front end and least recently pages 
    will be near the rear end.
    
    A Hash with page number as key and address of the corresponding queue node as value.
