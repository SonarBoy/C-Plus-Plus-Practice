Regular Expressions Notes-------------------------------------------

* = wild card = '.*'
    must be where charater is ouccoring 0 or more times

. = literal charaters
    matches a string literal charater

Repetition Operators 

? = preceeding item is optional and matched at most once.
* = preceeeding item will be matched 0 or more times.
+ = preceeding item will be matched 1 or more times.

Anchors:
    Anchors are used to match positions , not charaters
    By matching the start of a line or the end of a line,
    these meta charaters efficitively anchor the regex matches 
    at specific positions.

^ = start of line anchor
$ = represents end of line anchor

^\d+ 
\d = digit 
+ = repeats 1 or more times.

^\d+
    13 cats excaped from the 5 cages at the vet clinic.
    -returns 13.

^b[aiu]t$
    This line does not match but the next line does
    -return but

Word Boundaries
    Are used to match position before and after word charaters
    which creates a boundary. A word boundary is definied as a locations
    where there is a word charater on one side and not the other. These 
    word boundaries allow you to identify where word begins and ends.

    'scatty' 'scatter' 'cat' -match '\bcat\b'


{n} = the preceeding item is matched exactly n times.
{n,} = the preceeding is matched exactly n times.
{,m} = the precceding is matched n or more times.
{n,m} matche at least n times but no more than m times.

[] = charater class = what you put into it is what is matched.
    a set of charaters ised to express all possibilities at a specific point in a match.

[a-Z] = charater class range 
[0-9] = charater calls digit range
[^abcd] = not charater class
[^a-d] = not charater class range.

-i case note sensitive in grep

Alterations 
    are used to match a single regular expression out of several possible expression.

grep -eO 'Warden|Community|Lawrence' locations.csv

Shorthand MetaCharater

\w [a-z A-Z 0-9_] word charaters
\s whitespace charaters
\d [0-9] digit charaters
\w [^a-z A-Z 0-9 _] non-word
\S non-whitespace charaters
\D [^0-9] non-digit charaters
. any charater
\n new line charaters
\t tab charaters 
\r carrige returns charater.
